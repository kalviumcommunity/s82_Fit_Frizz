# Fit & Frizz

## Project Overview

Fit & Frizz is a unique platform designed to offer personalized hairstyle suggestions based on users' outfits. By simply uploading a picture of their outfit or describing its style, users will receive tailored hairstyle recommendations that complement their look. This platform combines fashion and beauty, creating a seamless, user-friendly experience where users can discover curated hairstyles that match their outfit's style, color, and occasion.

## Features

### 1. **Outfit Description**
- Users can upload an image or provide a description of their outfit, including details like the style (e.g., casual, formal), color, and the occasion (e.g., wedding, party, everyday wear).
  
### 2. **Hair Type Description**
- Users will describe their hair type (e.g., straight, curly, wavy) and length, as well as any specific preferences (e.g., hair volume, texture, or concerns).
  
### 3. **Hairstyle Suggestions**
- Based on the outfit and hair type inputs, the website will generate a range of hairstyle suggestions, including updos, braids, curls, sleek styles, and more.
- Each suggestion will be paired with a step-by-step tutorial or video guide to help users recreate the hairstyle easily.

### 4. **User Upload & Feedback**
- Users will be able to upload a photo of themselves with the suggested hairstyle to visualize how it looks with their outfit.
- Users can leave feedback and comments about their experience, creating a community-driven space for sharing tips and advice.
